<h1>Motivation</h1><br>

The increasing commercial interest in AI chips bears a strong indication that specialized hardware will play an essential role in the successful adoption of AI in mainstream embedded applications where fast response and energy efficiency are a concern. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which enable the hardware to be reprogrammed and customized for AI models, are now adopted by major chip manufacturers and AI service providers due to its versatility and affordability. However, modern FPGA based SoCs are equipped with heterogeneous processing elements, which makes design exploration a complex task. 
<BR>
Given the economic importance of domain-specific architectures, our research aims to dramatically increase the design productivity through innovative design methodologies that rely on hardware-efficient Intellectual Property (IP) cores in order to expedite algorithm-to-architecture mapping on the heterogenous processing elements of FPGA based SoCs.
<BR>
The following are some of our projects in this area:

<h1><u>Lifelong Deep Learning Architecture</u></h1><br>
Conventional deep learning models are trained once and deployed. However, models deployed in agents operating in dynamic environments need to constantly acquire new knowledge, while preventing catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. This ability is commonly referred to as lifelong learning. 
<BR>
We proposed a FPGA based architecture for a Self-Organization Neural Network SONN), that in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can perform class-incremental lifelong learning for object classification. The proposed SONN architecture is capable of performing unsupervised learning on input features from the CNN by dynamically growing neurons and connections. In order to meet the tight constraints of edge computing, we introduced efficient scheduling methods to maximize resource reuse and parallelism, as well as approximate computing strategies.

<h1><u>Hardware Accelerator for Visual SLAM</u></h1><br>
The pervasive adoption of cameras in various cutting-edge technologies today such as self-driving cars, robotics, virtual
reality and augmented reality, have elevated the need for computer vision algorithms that are robust and can deliver
high-speed solutions. A core application in these technologies is visual odometry or Simultaneous Localization And Mapping
(SLAM), which enables the system to localize itself in unknown environments. Feature matching plays a central role in this application to estimate the motion trajectory from one frame to the next.
<BR>
We proposed a deep-pipelined stream processing architecture that is capable of extracting rBRIEF (rotation-aware Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) from high-throughput video frames. To achieve high processing rate and low complexity hardware, the proposed architecture incorporates an enhanced moving summation strategy to calculate the key-points’ patch moments and employs approximate computations to achieve patch rotation. Multiplier-less circuitry is introduced throughout the architecture to avoid the use of costly multipliers.
