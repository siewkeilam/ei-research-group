<h1>Motivation</h1><br>

Camera-based sensors offer affordable sensing in public spaces and hence, they have become particularly important in many autonomous systems, surveillance, and traffic applications. However, in trying to be robust and adaptive to a variety of scenarios, the existing techniques are highly computationally intensive. Most of the existing solutions either rely on cloud-based computing, where the raw video data from all cameras is sent to the server for processing and analysis, or very expensive edge-computing and smart camera-based solutions. Neither of these options are scalable for large-scale deployment. 
Furthermore, due to privacy concerns, it is prohibitive to send raw video data from the camera sensors to a central location for visual analytics using cloud-grade GPUs. In addition, localized processing is critical for ensuring a high level of responsiveness of the system. 
<BR>
Our research investigates novel architecture-aware algorithms and design methodologies that can lead to low-complexity and real-time visual analytics for deployment on edge devices with tight computational constraints.
