<h1>Motivation</h1><br>

Embedded systems have become an integral part of our lives, and hence it is essential that they are secure. However, the focus so far has been on the development of software tools (e.g., antivirus, antimalware, firewalls) to protect these systems from malicious software. The recent micro-architectural attacks, such as Meltdown and Spectre, which exploit hardware vulnerabilities of the computer system (i.e. speculative execution and cache leakages) have raised major concerns as they cannot be traced by the above-mentioned software tools. This along with other well-known micro-architectural attacks like side-channel and row-hammer attacks exploit the peculiar characteristic of the computer hardware components (cache and memory modules) that manifest under specific circumstances. Due to the proliferation of embedded systems, these attacks can lead to devastating security implications at a wide scale.
<BR>
Our research focuses on protecting the confidentiality of the program and data when applications are deployed on edge devices. We investigate attacks that exploit side-channel leakages on edge devices, and develop frameworks for implementing applications securely on low-cost embedded computing systems in order to prevent program and data theft, while meeting the QoS performance, power, accuracy) requirements.
