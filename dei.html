<h1>Motivation</h1><br>

A key technological challenge of smart cities is the need to process extremely large amounts of geographically distributed sources of data in real-time. This challenge can only be efficiently addressed with a full distributed system architecture spanning from edge devices to large-scale cloud analytics. Our current research focuses on future mobility solutions which will become more demand responsive to deliver diversified, passenger-oriented solutions. Mass deployment of distributed low-cost smart sensors on roads and vehicles can be used to collaboratively provide high level information of passenger demand, incidents, congestion and traffic patterns. These information could enable users to instantly adapt their itineraries to newly available information. Operators of flexible mobility services, on the other hand, could use this information collected over time to adjust vehicle routes or schedules according to the current demand situation. In addition, this can also lead to the development of new infrastructures that increases the robustness and safety of the transport system.
<BR>
Presently, we are developing a framework that integrates input from our distributed smart sensors and traffic information, with AI optimization algorithms that can lead to new urban mobility solutions for traffic congestion management, increasing usage of public transport, and better planning of Singaporeâ€™s transportation infrastructure.
